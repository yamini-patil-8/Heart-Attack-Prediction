# Heart-Attack-Prediction

*Project Motive*
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to automate heart disease prediction using machine learning algorithms to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, especially in areas with limited expertise.

*Algorithms Used*
1.Logestic Regression
2.Naive Bayes
3.k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
4.Decision Tree
5.Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
6.Random Forest

*Dataset Attributes*
The dataset includes health parameters such as:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), Resting ECG (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate (thalach), Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression (oldpeak), Slope, Major Vessels (ca), Thalassemia (thal)

Target (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)

*Results*
Among the implemented algorithms, Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy of 88% in predicting heart disease.
